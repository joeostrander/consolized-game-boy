2023.10.05 v2.2.0
- re-adding old-school nes controller support (disabled in firmware, but option is in code)
- reordering the color schemes
- adding OSD line option to reverse RGB bits

2023.10.05 v2.1.1
- Turns out I had bit order reversed on VGA.  One option would have been to swap resistors for bit 6/7 of each color channel... instead I decided to swap bits in code.
- disabling the onboard LED blink on button press
- re-adding select+start hotkey for NES classic controller (doesn't have HOME button)

2023.05.07 v2.1.0
- Removed pixel & scanline effects -- they were cheesy
- Changed code to use scanvideo built-in video mode scaling, eliminating the need to manually scale
- Changed Gameboy video scanning to use gpio interrupt on vsync instead of polling 
- moved color/scheme stuff to colors.c
- stopped overclocking

2023.01.15 
- Original NES Controller no longer supported in code, but I'll leave the uf2 here for it...
- OSD now activated with HOME button on the Wii/NES Classic controller
